# Cheetah Cryptographic Key Generator

## Overview
The Cheetah Cryptographic Key Generator is a Streamlit application that utilizes unique patterns in cheetah images to generate cryptographic keys. This project showcases image processing techniques and the use of encryption algorithms in Python.

### How It Works
The application processes an uploaded cheetah image to isolate specific patterns (contours) and then uses these patterns to generate a cryptographic key. This key is then used for encrypting and decrypting user-input messages, demonstrating the concept of symmetric key cryptography.

### Features
- Image processing to isolate cheetah spots.
- Generation of cryptographic keys based on image patterns.
- Encryption and decryption of messages using the generated key.
- Interactive UI with Streamlit for adjusting image processing parameters.
